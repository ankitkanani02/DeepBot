## Introduction
The DeepBot project demonstrates how to create a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot is designed to interact with users and provide appropriate responses based on the predicted intent tag. This README provides an overview of the project structure and explains how to run the training and chatbot code.

## Project Structure
The DeepBot project consists of the following files and directories:

```
- deepbot/
    - intents.json
    - train.py
    - chatbot.py
- README.md
```

The `deepbot` directory contains the main project files, including `intents.json`, `train.py`, and `chatbot.py`. The `intents.json` file holds the training data for the chatbot, while `train.py` and `chatbot.py` contain the training code and chatbot code, respectively.

## Training Code
The training code, located in `train.py`, performs the following steps:

1. Imports the necessary libraries and dependencies:

```python
import json
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
```

2. Reads the content of the `intents.json` file and stores it in the `data` variable:

```python
with open('intents.json') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
```

3. Processes the training data and prepares it for further processing:

```python
training_sentences = []
training_labels = []
responses = []
labels = []
num_classes = 0

# Iterate over each intent
for intent in data['intents']:
    patterns = intent['patterns']
    training_sentences += patterns
    training_labels += [intent['tag']] * len(patterns)
    responses += intent['responses']

    # Check if intent tag is not already in labels list
    if intent['tag'] not in labels:
        labels.append(intent['tag'])

# Get the number of distinct classes
num_classes = len(labels)

# Tokenization and padding
# ...

# Text classification model implementation
# ...

# Model training
# ...

# Save the trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder objects
# ...
```

## Chatbot Code
The chatbot code, located in `chatbot.py`, allows the user to interact with the trained chatbot. Here's an overview of the code:

1. Loads the trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder objects:

```python
# Load the trained model
# ...

# Load the fitted tokenizer and label encoder
# ...
```

2. Runs a loop to continuously prompt the user for input and generate responses:

```python
while True:
    user_input = input('User: ')
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
        break
    
    # Process the user's input using the model and generate a response
    # ...
```

## Usage
To use the DeepBot chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the DeepBot project repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepbot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd deepbot
```

3. Run the training code to train the chatbot model:

```shell
python train.py
```

4. Once the training is complete, you can now run the chatbot code to interact with the DeepBot chatbot:

```shell
python chatbot.py
```

5. The chatbot will prompt you for input. Type your message and press Enter. The chatbot will process your input and generate an appropriate response based on the predicted intent.
